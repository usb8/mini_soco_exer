# Mini Social

This is a mock social media platform created for the Social Computing course at the University of Oulu by Dr. Aku Visuri and Daniel Szabo.

The codebase contains three missing implementations, which you find [at end of app.py](https://github.com/Crowd-Computing-Oulu/mini_social_exercise/blob/44117e36e609b52c3452226797a0fd3fb5ff5258/app.py#L886).

The repository contains a ready database, you do not have to create your own data.
